  Flood Fill

  Most graphical “paint” applications, have a ‘paintcan fill’ function that floods part of an image with a certain color. We change the image as if we painted a canvas: a two-dimensional array of integers, where each integer represents a color for that pixel. The canvas Array.length is the Y dimension of our canvas; each spot in the canvas array is a row in our image, with a length equal to our canvas’ X dimension. You are given a canvas (2 dimensional array of integers), starting coordinate (2-element array), and the color to flood (integer value). 
  
  Build floodFill(canvas2D,startXY,newColor) 
  Replace a pixel’s color value only if it is the same color as the origin coordinate and is directly adjacent via X or Y to another pixel you will change. Note: diagonally related pixels are not considered adjacent.

  **Example**
  Input:
  canvas2D = 
  [
    [3, 2, 3, 4, 3],
    [2, 3, 3, 4, 0],
    [7, 3, 3, 5, 3],
    [6, 5, 3, 4, 1],
    [1, 2, 3, 3, 3]
  ]

  and startXY of [2,2], and newColor of 1.

  we examine the cells that are directly (not diagonally) adjacent to startXY. If any have a value of 3 (the original value at startXY), we change its value to 1 ( newColor ) and repeat the process with its directly-adjacent neighbor cells. We repeat this until th e entire zone of similarly-colored cells is changed .

  Output:
  [
    [3, 2, 1, 4, 3],
    [2, 1, 1, 4, 0],
    [7, 1, 1, 5, 3],
    [6, 5, 1, 4, 1],
    [1, 2, 1, 1, 1 ]
]

**Tips**
// Add params if needed
*/
// function floodFill(canvas2D, startXY, newColor) {}
function floodFill(canvas2D, startXY, newColor, originalColor = null) {
  
}

const canvas = [
  [3, 2, 3, 4, 3],
  [2, 3, 3, 4, 0],
  [7, 3, 3, 5, 3],
  [6, 5, 3, 4, 1],
  [1, 2, 3, 3, 3],
];
