/* 
  This is more of a free-form algo to practice some OOP
  
  Create a chair class that has the following properties and functionality:
  color
  weight
  name
  Has a certain number of wheels (each wheel has a color and could be broken or not)
  Can be raised / lowered
  Can be reclined / not reclined
  Can be occupied / not occupied
  An instance of a person can perform a "sit" action and will update a chair to be occupied with said person
  Bonus: rig the chair with an eject functionality that ejects the current occupant out of the chair
