# Given a string of length n and an integer k. The string can be manipulated by taking one of the first k letters and moving it to the end of the string.

# Write a program to determine the lexicographically smallest string that can be created after an unlimited number of moves

# For example, suppose we are given the string 'daily' and k = 1. The best we can create in this case is ailyd
